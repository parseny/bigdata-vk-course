"YODA"	"Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years  have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.  This one a long time have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.  You are reckless!"
"VADER"	"There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet  realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy."
"LEIA"	"All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The  heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports."
"THREEPIO"	"Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the  thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know."
"LANDO"	"That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over  everything we've built here. But things have developed that will insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever."
"VEERS"	"My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has  detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment."
"LUKE"	"If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to  agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like... something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going crazy."
"PIETT"	"Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and  found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now."
"NEEDA"	"...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they  appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've sustained, they must have been destroyed."
"REBEL CAPTAIN"	"Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the  speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch."
"HAN"	"Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of  the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on the power cables."
"RIEEKAN"	"Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold  them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault."
"ZEV"	"This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain  Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge Two."
"BEN"	"But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when  you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force."
"CREATURE"	"Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.   Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become Jedi? Hm?"
"DECK OFFICER"	"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the  south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in."
"OZZEL"	"My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be  smugglers, it could be..."
"DERLIN"	"Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The  shield doors must be closed."
"CONTROLLER"	"General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of  hyperspace in sector four."
"DACK"	"Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut  in the auxiliary."
"LIEUTENANT"	"Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from  Skywalker or Solo."
"EMPEROR"	"The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not  become a Jedi."
"SECOND CONTROLLER"	"Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star  Destroyer Avenger."
"MEDICAL DROID"	"Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-  sevens."
"ASSISTANT OFFICER"	"I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set  screen alpha."
"TRACKING OFFICER"	"Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our  scopes."
"SENIOR CONTROLLER"	"No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming  through."
"INTERCOM VOICE"	"Permission granted to land on Platform  Three-two-seven."
"COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER"	"Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the  pursuit."
"BOBA FETT"	"What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me."
"ANNOUNCER"	"Headquarters personnel, report to command  center."
"WEDGE"	"Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous."
"IMPERIAL SOLDIER"	"Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class."
"HOBBIE"	"Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?"
"IMPERIAL OFFICER"	"Skywalker has just landed, my lord."
"HEAD CONTROLLER"	"K-one-zero...all troops disengage."
"TRENCH OFFICER"	"We have spotted Imperial walkers!"
"CAPTAIN"	"Good. Our first catch of the day."
"WOMAN CONTROLLER"	"Stand by, ion control....Fire!"
"PILOT"	"One-seven, decimal two-eight."
"JANSON"	"Coming around. Once more."
"STRANGE VOICE"	"Feel like what?"
"OFFICER"	"Begin retreat!"
"PILOTS"	"Right. Okay."
"MAN"	"Who are you?"
"REBEL FIGHTER"	"Right, sir."
"SECOND OFFICER"	"Fall back!"
"SECOND THREEPIO"	"E chu ta!"
"FIRST CONTROLLER"	"Yes, sir."
